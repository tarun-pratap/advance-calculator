a version control system is like a smart backup system 
for our files
Imagine Writing a Book
Initial Draft: You start writing a book. Every day, you write a few pages.
Daily Backup: At the end of each day, you save a new copy of your book with the date in
 the filename (e.g., book_2023-07-01.doc, book_2023-07-02.doc).
Organization: Keeps everything neat and organized.
Safety: Prevents data loss and allows you to recover from mistakes.
Collaboration: Makes it easy to work with others without stepping on each other's toes.
Accountability: You can see who made which changes and when.
a version control system helps you keep track of changes to files, making it easier to manage,
 collaborate, and maintain a history of your work.
